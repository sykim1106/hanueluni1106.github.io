Wednesday 31th of July, 2019

I was so nervous. Because this trip was an overseas trip for the first time in five years.

## In Flight

You should take a deep nap in flight. Because you need Parallax adaptation.

And..I advise you to take slipper(which is laid at your flight) into your hotel. In U.S, the floor is carpeted...
